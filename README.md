In order to generate 10 random snakes of random lengths of randomly shaped rectangles with random sensor placement, clone this branch of the repo and run **search.py**.

Here is a cartoon to explain how I generated the brains and bodies of the snakes:

I basically used the height and width divided by 2 to calculate the relative positions of the links. For each link, I flipped a proverbial coin to decide if it would be a sensor link or not.
