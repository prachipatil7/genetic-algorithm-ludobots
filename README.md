# CS_396: Artificial Life - Final Project (The Scientist)
cs396: artificial life -- r/ludobots project

## Background

[10 second teaser gif]

## Installation and Running Robots
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Hypothesis

1. **It is more efficient to start off with a simple body and let the algorithm evolve its appendages, rather than starting out with a complex body with many parts.**
2. **Simpler bodies have higher fitness overall.**

## Experiment

## Brains and Bodies

## Mutation
